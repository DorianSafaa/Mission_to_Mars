# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview of the Project

In this project, we are gathering data about a mission to Mars from different sources and displayeing these information in a web application. The web application will let you get the latest news and images about Mars with a click of a button.

## Application

We started by building a python script than can navigate the webpages and collect the right information. Next, we stored the collected data in MongoDB since we are working with different forms of data. Lastly, we created the web application using Flask. 

## Tools

- Splinter to automate the browser
- BeautifulSoup to scrape data
- MongoDB to store the data
- Flask to create the web application

## Result

As a result, we have a web application that highlights information about Mars such as: Latest news, Featured photo of Mars and Hemisphere, Fact table comparing Mars and Earth. Also, the web application is mobile-responsive.
